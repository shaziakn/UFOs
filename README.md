# UFOs
The purpose of this project is to build a webpage and a dynamic table that allow users to search for specific UFO sighting events based on date, city, state, country, and shape.
Technologies utilized include the language JavaScript, VS Code, along with HTML to build the webpage and CSS to style the webpage.
The code produced in the challenge attempts to filter by each of the five arguments. One recommendation for further development would be to have the table appear higher on the webpage instead of having to scroll down to see filtered results.
